In a scripting language of your choice, write a Verilog Quartus Mapping (VQM) netlist parser to produce a CSV file of all nodes in the given netlist (fp_pow.vqm) and their respective fanouts, ordered by fanout (highest first). Example output:

net_a,1000
net_b,999
net_c,100

The Verilog files in /sim contain declarations of all modules present in the VQM. Treat assign statements as though they were single input-single output gates.

You may make use of any libraries that come as part of the standard package for your chosen scripting language, but not those that require independent installation.

Ideally, your solution should also:

- Be fast.
- Be intelligible.
- Work for other device families, given the appropriate module declaration input.
- Be easily adaptable to other graph-processing tasks.

Hint: ignore [a-z]+_unconnected_wire_\d+ -- these are present by virtue of a bug in the netlist writer for Cyclone V devices.
